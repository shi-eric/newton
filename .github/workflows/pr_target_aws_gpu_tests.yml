          ## ⚠️ Manual Approval Required

          This PR was authored by an external contributor. GPU tests require manual approval from a maintainer before they can run.

          ### Are you a newton-physics org member?

          If your membership is set to **Private**, the workflow cannot detect it. To fix:

          1. Go to [newton-physics People](https://github.com/orgs/newton-physics/people)
          2. Find your username and change visibility from **Private** to **Public**
          3. Push a new commit to re-trigger the check
          EOF
          fi
